The **Wyoming** {% term integration %} connects external voice services to Home Assistant using a [small protocol](https://github.com/rhasspy/rhasspy3/blob/master/docs/wyoming.md). This enables [Assist](/voice_control/) to use a variety of local [speech-to-text](/integrations/stt/), [text-to-speech](/integrations/tts/), and [wake-word-detection](/integrations/wake_word/) systems, such as:

- Whisper {% my supervisor_addon badge addon="core_whisper" %}
- Piper {% my supervisor_addon badge addon="core_piper" %}
- openWakeWord {% my supervisor_addon badge addon="core_openwakeword" %}

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Satellites

[Remote voice satellites](https://github.com/rhasspy/wyoming-satellite) can be connected to Home Assistant using the Wyoming protocol. These satellites typically run on Raspberry Pi's, and are automatically discovered by Home Assistant through [Zeroconf](/integrations/zeroconf).
