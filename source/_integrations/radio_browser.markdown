The Radio Browser integration allows you to use the directory of
radio stations collected on [Radio Browser](https://www.radio-browser.info)
in Home Assistant.

All radio stations can be browsed and played via the Media panel in
Home Assistant.

Additionally, when creating automations, the "Play Media" action can be used
to pick a station from the directory. This makes it possible to create
an automation that e.g., starts playing your favorite radio station on your
Cast devices.
