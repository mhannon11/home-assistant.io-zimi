This section gives a high-level introduction to blueprints. To view a description of the YAML-schema used to create a valid blueprint, refer to the section [About the blueprint schema](/docs/blueprint/schema/).

## What is a blueprint?

A blueprint is a {% term script %} or {% term automation %} configuration with certain parts marked as configurable. This allows you to create different scripts or automations based on the same blueprint.

Imagine you want to control lights based on motion. A blueprint provides the generic {% term automation %} framework, while letting you select one specific motion sensor as a {% term trigger %}, and the exact light to control. This blueprint makes it possible to create two automations. Each automation has their own configuration and act completely independently. Yet, they share some basic automation configuration so that you do not have to set this up every time.

Blueprints are shared by the community in the [blueprint community forum][blueprint-forums].
