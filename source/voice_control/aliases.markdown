Assist will use the names of your entities, as well as any aliases you've configured.

![Alias example](/images/blog/2023-01/aliases-cloud-multi-language.png)

By adding aliases in your native language, you can speak to Home Assistant with the language configured on your [Android watch](/voice_control/android/) or [Apple device](/voice_control/apple/).
