## Adding a wake word to your voice assistant

{% include voice_assistant/add_wake_word_to_voice_assistant.md %}

## Installing the software onto the ATOM Echo

If you have used the ATOM Echo on Home Assistant before and have it installed via ESPHome add-on, you first need to remove its configuration.

### To delete the configuration from ESPHome

{% include voice_assistant/install_esp_firmware_delete_firmware.md %}

### To install the software on your ATOM Echo

Before you can use this device with Home Assistant, you need to install a bit of software on it.

1. Make sure this page is opened in a Chromium-based browser on a desktop. It does not work on a tablet or phone.
   - Select the **Connect** button below. If your browser does not support web serial, you will see a warning instead of a button.

      <script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/esp-web-tools@9/dist/web/install-button.js?module"></script>
      <esp-web-install-button manifest="https://firmware.esphome.io/voice-assistant/m5stack-atom-echo/manifest.json"></esp-web-install-button>
   - **For advanced users**: The configuration file is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/esphome/firmware/blob/main/voice-assistant/m5stack-atom-echo.yaml).

{% include voice_assistant/install_esp_firmware.md %}
9.  Select the **ESPHome** integration. Under **Devices**, you should see the **M5Stack Atom Echo** listed.

   - Your ATOM Echo is connected to Home Assistant over Wi-Fi. You can now move it to any place in your home with a USB power supply.
10.  Congratulations! You can now voice control Home Assistant using a button with a built-in microphone. Now give some commands.

## Controlling Home Assistant over the ATOM Echo

1. Say your wake word. For this tutorial, use "OK, Nabu".
   - Wait for the LED to start blinking in blue.
2. Say a [supported voice command](/voice_control/builtin_sentences/). For example, *Turn off the light in the kitchen*.
   - While you are speaking, the blue LED keeps pulsing.
   - Once the intent has been processed, the LED lights up in green and Home Assistant confirms the action.
      - Make sure youâ€™re using the area name exactly as you defined it in Home Assistant.
      - You can also ask a question, such as
          - *Is the front door locked?*
          - *Which lights are on in the living room?*
3. Your command is not supported? Add your own commands using [a sentence trigger](/voice_control/custom_sentences/).
4. You find ATOM Echo takes too long to start processing your command?
   - Adjust the silence detection settings. This setting defines how much silence is needed for Assist to find you're done speaking and it can start processing your command.
   - Go to {% my integrations title="**Settings** > **Devices & Services**" %} and select the **ESPHome** integration.
   - Under **M5Stack ATOM Echo**, select **1 device**.

## Disabling wake word and use push-to-talk

1. If you do not want to use a wake word, but prefer to use the microphone by pressing a button, you can disable the wake word.
2. Go to {% my integrations title="**Settings** > **Devices & Services**" %} and select the **ESPHome** integration.
   - Under **M5Stack ATOM Echo**, select **1 device**.
3. Disable **Use wake word**.
   
   ![Toggle to enable/disable wake word](/images/assist/wake_word_disable_on_atom_echo.png)
4. To start using push-to-talk, press the flat button with rounded shape on your ATOM Echo.
   - The rectangular button on the side is the reset button. Do not press that one.
   - As soon as you press the button, the LED will start blinking in blue. If it does not light up, press again.
   - While you are speaking, the blue LED is pulsing.
   - Once the intent has been processed, the LED lights up in green and Home Assistant confirms the action.

## Troubleshooting

Are things not working as expected?

- Checkout the [general troubleshooting section for Assist](/voice_control/troubleshooting/).
- You think there is a problem with noise or volume? Checkout the procedure below.

### Tweaking the ATOM Echo configuration

1. Make sure you have [access to your configuration files](/common-tasks/os/#configuring-access-to-files).
2. Edit the general configuration:
   - Access the `config` folder and open the `configuration.yaml` file.
   - Enter the following text:
      ```yaml
      assist_pipeline:
         debug_recording_dir: /share/assist_pipeline
      ```
3. Save the changes and restart Home Assistant.
4. Make sure you have the [Samba add-on installed](/common-tasks/os/#configuring-access-to-files).
5. On your computer, access your Home Assistant server via Samba.
   - Navigate to `/share/assist_pipeline`.
   - For each voice command you gave, you will find a subfolder with the audio file in `.wav` format.
6. Listen to the audio file of interest.
7. Adjust noise suppression and volume, if needed:
   - Access the `config` folder and open the `esphome/m5stack-atom-echo-wake-word.yaml` file.
   - Find the `voice_assistant` section.
   - If the audio is too noisy, increase the `noise_suppression_level` (max.&nbsp;4).
   - If the audio is too quiet, increase either the `auto_gain` (max.&nbsp;31) or the `volume_multiplier` (no maximum, but a too high value will cause distortion eventually).
8. Collecting the debug recordings impacts your disk space.
   - Once you have found a configuration that works, delete the folder with the audio files.
   - In the `configuration.yaml` file, delete the `assist_pipeline entry` and restart Home Assistant.
